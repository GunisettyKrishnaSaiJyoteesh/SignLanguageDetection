# Sign Language with Sentence Construction and Language Translation

This project leverages computer vision and deep learning to recognize hand gestures, construct sentences, and translate them into multiple languages with speech synthesis. Designed to assist individuals with hearing and speech impairments, it provides a seamless communication experience.

## Features
- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition:** Captures and identifies hand gestures in real-time.
- **Sentence Construction:** Dynamically builds sentences from recognized gestures.
- **Multi-Language Translation:** Translates constructed sentences into various languages.
- **Text-to-Speech Integration:** Converts text into speech for enhanced communication.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for ease of use.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, pyttsx3
- **Frameworks:** Tkinter for GUI
- **APIs:** Translation and suggestion APIs
